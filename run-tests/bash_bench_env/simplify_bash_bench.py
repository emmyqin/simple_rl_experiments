PROMPT = """The following is a programming exercise. It consists of a task description, public tests, and private tests.
Someone will have to solve this exercise. They will be able to use public tests to debug their solution. Then, the correctness of their solution will be determined based on whether it passes the private tests, which they don't have access to.

Please write a much simpler version of the problem.
This involves coming up with a simpler version of the task, as well as public and private tests that test whether a solution to the task is correct.
It is important for you not to make any mistakes when writing the tests, so pay extra attention to them and don't do things that are too complicated.

Some ways you could simplify the problem in are:
- If the problem asks to do multiple things, make a task which only asks to do one of them.
- If the task asks to do something complicated, the simplified task could ask for a less complicated version (e.g. a toy verison, a less efficient version, etc).
- Include detailed hints that explain a significant part of the solution.
You are not forced to only simplify the problem in this way and are encouraged to simplify it in other ways if you see other ways that are more appropriate to the problem.

=== TASK DESCRIPTION ===
{task_description}
=== END TASK DESCRIPTION ===

=== PUBLIC TESTS ===
{public_tests}
=== END PUBLIC TESTS ===

=== PRIVATE TESTS ===
{private_tests}
=== END PRIVATE TESTS ===

Please format your response the following way:

Thorough thinking about simplifying the task goes here.

=== TASK DESCRIPTION ===
The simplified task description you came up with goes here.
=== END TASK DESCRIPTION ===

=== PUBLIC TESTS ===
The public tests you came up with go here.
=== END PUBLIC TESTS ===

=== PRIVATE TESTS ===
The private tests you came up with go here.
